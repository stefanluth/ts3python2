# TS3Client

## Introduction

The `TS3Client` class provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with the TeamSpeak 3 server.

It is built on top of the `TS3Query` class and provides a more intuitive interface for performing common tasks such
as moving users, receiving and sending messages.

## Initialization

If no host and port are provided, the TS3Client will not connect to a server. Instead you can use the
`TS3Client.connect()` method to connect to a server.
If no login and password are provided, the query client will not be logged in.
You can login with the `TS3Client.login()` method after the TS3Client has been instantiated instead.
