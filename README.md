# TeamSpeak 3 Python Interface 2

## About

This is a **very** simple pythonic interface for interacting with the TeamSpeak 3 Server Query.

I mainly made this repository to use in other personal projects.
I felt like others might find it useful, so I made it public.

There are other, **better** interfaces on GitHub, like
[@benediktschmitt's](https://github.com/benediktschmitt) excellent
[API](https://github.com/benediktschmitt/py-ts3/tree/v2) or
[@Murgeye's](https://github.com/Murgeye)
[API](https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-api) and
[Bot](https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-bot).

I have resorted to writing my own versions from scratch because those projects were too big and extensive for my needs, and also because it's fun!
