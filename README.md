# TeamSpeak 3 Python Interface

## About

This is a **very** simple pythonic interface for interacting with the TeamSpeak 3 Server Query.
<br>
I mainly made this repository to use in other projects.
I felt like others might find it useful, so I made it public.
<br><br>
There are other, **better** interfaces on GitHub, like
<a href='https://github.com/benediktschmitt'>@benediktschmitt's</a> excellent
<a href='https://github.com/benediktschmitt/py-ts3/tree/v2'>API</a> or
<a href='https://github.com/Murgeye'>@Murgeye's</a>
<a href='https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-api'>API</a> and
<a href='https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-bot'>Bot</a>.
<br>
I have resorted to writing my own versions from scratch because those projects were too big and extensive for my needs, and also because it's fun!

## Questions

If you have questions on how to use this repository, open an issue; I'll be happy to help.

## Suggestions

If you have feature requests e.g. commands that the `TS3Bot` doesn't currently support or a module you need,
just create an issue and I'll check it out. Or you can always create a pull request for me to review, if you
have written your own solution to a problem that you had and believe others could benefit from it too.
<br><br>
And ~~if~~ **when** you find ways to improve the code, please open a PR and let me know about it;
I love to learn and I know my code is far from perfect.

## License

I just copied the generic Creative Commons Zero license, because it ensures I'm not liable for anything going wrong
and I don't have to give any warranty that this stuff actually works.
