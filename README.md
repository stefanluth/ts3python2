# TeamSpeak 3 Python Interface 2

## About

This is a straightforward Python interface that can be used to interact with the TeamSpeak 3 Server Query.

I created this repository primarily for my own use in other projects.
However, I figured that other people may also find it helpful, so I decided to make it public.

There are other, more sophisticated interfaces available on GitHub,
such as the excellent API by @benediktschmitt, as well as the API and Bot by @Murgeye.

Because those projects were too extensive for my needs and I enjoy programming,
I chose to create my own versions from scratch.
This is simply a personal project that I created for fun and learning.

## Documentation

The `docs` directory in this repository contains documentation for this project.
The documentation explains how to use the interface and provides detailed information on write plugins.

## Questions

If you have any questions about how to use this repository, feel free to open an issue, and I'll be happy to assist you.

## Suggestions

And ~~if~~ **when** you find ways to improve the code, please open a PR and let me know
about it; I'm eager to learn, and I know that my code has plenty of room for improvement.

## Previous Version

I made my [previous version](https://github.com/stefanluth/ts3python) of a pythonic TS3
query interface quite some time ago, when I knew a lot less about programming.
My hope is to improve my code and my understanding of Python with this new version.
The previous version is still available on GitHub, but I will not be maintaining it.
