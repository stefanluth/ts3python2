# TeamSpeak 3 Python Interface 2

## About

This is a **very** simple pythonic interface for interacting with the TeamSpeak 3 Server
Query.

I mainly made this repository to use in other personal projects.
I felt like others might find it useful, so I made it public.

There are other, **better** interfaces on GitHub, like
[@benediktschmitt's](https://github.com/benediktschmitt) excellent
[API](https://github.com/benediktschmitt/py-ts3/tree/v2) or
[@Murgeye's](https://github.com/Murgeye)
[API](https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-api) and
[Bot](https://github.com/Murgeye/teamspeak3-python-bot).

I have resorted to writing my own versions from scratch because those projects were too
big and extensive for my needs, and also because it's fun!
This is just a personal project for fun and learning.

## Questions

If you have questions on how to use this repository, open an issue; I'll be happy to help.

## Suggestions

And ~~if~~ **when** you find ways to improve the code, please open a PR and let me know
about it; I love to learn and I know my code is far from perfect.

## License

I just copied the MIT license, because it ensures I'm not liable for anything going wrong
and I don't have to give any warranty that this stuff actually works.

## Previous Version

I made my [previous version](https://github.com/stefanluth/ts3python) of a pythonic TS3
query interface quite some time ago, when I knew a lot less about programming.
My hope is to improve my code and my understanding of Python with this new version.
The previous version is still available on GitHub, but I will not be maintaining it.
